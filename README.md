## fly
The fly script will reconsolidate video files recorded from a [Fly6 Original](https://cycliq.com/support/fly6-original/). The files are split into 10 minute segments. The file and directory naming scheme allows you to infer the date, timestamp, and segment. These files are then recombined into a single file using the ISO 8601 format.
